# **Python**
Python is a powerful multi-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum. It has simple easy-to-use syntax, making it the perfect language for someone trying to learn computer programming for the first time.
Python is a general purpose and high level programming language. You can use Python for developing desktop GUI applications, websites and web applications.

## **Why should Python be used?**
**Readbale**

Python, unlike other programming languages, emphasizes on code readability, and allows you to use English keywords instead of punctuations.

**Multiple Programming Paradigm**

It supports object oriented and structured programming fully. Also, its language features support various concepts in functional and aspect-oriented programming. At the same time, Python also features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.

**Compatible with Major Platforms and Systems**

At present, Python is supports many operating systems. You can even use Python interpreters to run the code on specific platforms and tools.It allows you to you to run the same code on multiple platforms without recompilation.

**Robust Standard Library**

Its large and robust standard library makes Python score over other programming languages. The standard library allows you to choose from a wide range of modules according to your precise needs. Each module further enables you to add functionality to the Python application without writing additional code. 

**Many Open Source Frameworks and Tools**

As an open source programming language, Python helps you to curtail software development cost significantly. You can even use several open source Python frameworks, libraries and development tools.

## **Python Programs**
### 1. Character_Input.py
   Printing a message which tells user the year when they will turn 100 years old by taking input as user's username and age.
   
   [Character_Input.py](https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mane/Python/blob/master/Character_Input.py)
### 2. Divisors.py
   Print Divisors list of a number by taking number from user.
   
   [Divisors.py](https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mane/Python/blob/master/Divisors.py)
### 3. Odd_or_Even.py
   Print whether number is odd or even and if number is even then check it is a multiple of 4 or not.
   
   [Odd_or_Even.py](https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mane/Python/blob/master/Odd_or_Even.py)
### 4. Print_List.py
   Print numbers in a list in one line which are less than the user's input.
  
  [Print_List.py](https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mane/Python/blob/master/Print_List.py)
### 5. Check_Primality_Functions.py
   Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not.
  
  [Check_Primality_Functions.py](https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mane/Python/blob/master/Check_Primality_Functions.py)
### 6. Cows_and_Bulls.py
   Randomly generating a 4-digit number. The user have to guess a 4-digit number. For every digit that the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a “cow”. For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place is a “bull.” It will tell user how many “cows” and “bulls” he/she have. Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over. 

  [Cows_and_Bulls.py](https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mane/Python/blob/master/Cows_and_Bulls.py)
### 7. Guessing_Game.py
   Generating a random number between 1 and 9. Asks the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.
  
  [Guessing_Game.py](https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mane/Python/blob/master/Guessing_Game.py)
### 8. List_Comprehensions.py
   One line of Python that takes the list and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
  
  [List_Comprehensions.py](https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mane/Python/blob/master/List_Comprehensions.py)
### 9. List_Ends.py
   A program that takes a list of numbers and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. 
  
  [List_Ends.py](https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mane/Python/blob/master/List_Ends.py)
### 10. List_Overlap.py
   A program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the two lists of different sizes(without duplicates). 

  [List_Overlap.py](https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mane/Python/blob/master/List_Overlap.py)
### 11. List_Overlap_Comprehensions.py
   A program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates) in one line of python code using at least one list comprehension. 

  [List_Overlap_Comprehensions.py](https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mane/Python/blob/master/List_Overlap_Comprehensions.py)
### 12. List_Remove_Duplicates.py
   A program that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

  [List_Remove_Duplicates.py](https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mane/Python/blob/master/List_Remove_Duplicates.py)
### 13. Password_Generator.py
  A password generator in Python - generates strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords are random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. 

  [Password_Generator.py](https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mane/Python/blob/master/Password_Generator.py)
### 14. Reverse_Word_Order.py
  A program that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. 
  
  [Reverse_Word_Order.py](https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mane/Python/blob/master/Reverse_Word_Order.py)
### 15. Rock_Paper_Scissors.py
  A two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game!
  
  [Rock_Paper_Scissors.py](https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mane/Python/blob/master/Rock_Paper_Scissors.py)
### 16. String_Lists.py
  Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)
  
  [String_Lists.py](https://github.com/Aakanksha-Mane/Python/blob/master/String_Lists.py)
### 17. Fibonacci.py
  A program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them.
